# Windows Notifier Cloud Admin – Frontend (Preview Scaffold)

Lightweight React + Vite scaffold; API wiring comes in later phases.

## Prereqs
- Node 18+ (LTS recommended)

## Install
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run (dev)
```bash
npm run dev
# opens http://localhost:5173
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- UI currently uses placeholder data for Modules and Campaigns; buttons are disabled until API wiring.
- Configure API base URL when connecting to backend (future task).
